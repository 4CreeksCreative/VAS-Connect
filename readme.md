VAS-connect Website

## Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed `npm i -g roots` (mac users need to install roots globally **without** admin rights)
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch` to compile the site and view it in a browser

## Deploying

- If you just want to compile the site build, run `roots compile` and it will build to public folder.
